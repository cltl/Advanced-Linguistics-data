It also draws the attention on the need for the appropriate authorities to consider and mitigate the safety risk and potential congestion consequences in the event that operators decide to circumnavigate various airspaces affected by conflict. Its issuance is the latest of several actions taken by ICAO in the aftermath of the downing of Flight MH17, including coordination with the United Nations Security Council, the sending of experts to assist in the accident investigation and regular briefings to States of the ICAO Council.
